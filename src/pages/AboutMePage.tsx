          <p>
            One of my many dreams is to make **education easier**. I’ve had to
            go through so many painful and outdated educational experiences for
            which I now have an urging thirst to abolish. One of the many things
            I would want to introduce to formal education is an official media
            hub where videos of other students, explaining the same subject in
            the way they personally understand it, giving other students
            multiple viewpoints on the same matter. Teaching is a form of
            learning and I don’t understand how it’s not part of education.

          I’m really interested in **intuitively organizing information** in
          which I attempted to create the ultimate note-taking app which would
          outmatch Notion by a long shot.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m really interested in the idea of adding real **philosophy to
          children's books**, in a way that both teaches the parent real wisdom,
          through the book’s symbolism, and will later be realized by the child
          later in its life.
