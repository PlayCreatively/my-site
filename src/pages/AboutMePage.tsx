          <p>
            My biggest aspiration is to make learning more
            <a className="Highlight"> approachable</a>,
            <a className="Highlight"> digestable</a> and
            <a className="Highlight"> interactable</a>. I believe we're learning
            very inefficiently, whether by spending a lot of time forcibly
            learning through a seriously dry manner or by short-lived parrot
            learning that does no more than get you through the upcoming test.
            <br />
            <br />
            Here are proponents I believe have an important influence on
            learning quality:

          One of my many dreams is to make **education easier**. I’ve had to
          go through so many painful and outdated educational experiences for
          which I now have an urging thirst to abolish. One of the many things
          I would want to introduce to formal education is an official media
          hub where videos of other students, explaining the same subject in
          the way they personally understand it, giving other students
          multiple viewpoints on the same matter. Teaching is a form of
          learning and I don’t understand how it’s not part of education.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m really interested in **intuitively organizing information** in
          which I attempted to create the ultimate note-taking app which would
          outmatch Notion by a long shot.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m really interested in the idea of adding real **philosophy to
          children's books**, in a way that both teaches the parent real wisdom,
          through the book’s symbolism, and will later be realized by the child
          later in its life.
